- Change operations message to a dynamic array
    DONE
- Change string props to be dynamic length strings for better memory usage
    DONE
- Convert refactor Animation to use protobuf
    Thinking in heaving each animation be an OperationMessage
    each reconciler would need to implement a animation callback that takes
    the percentage and what props should be affected. Something like

    callback = reconcilers_registry_get_animation_callback(nodeType);

    callback(nodeId, propsNames, percent);

    DONE
